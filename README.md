# Manage Twitch Subscriptions

## Overview
Simple web application that allows users to register, login and then add
twitch streamers to thier account. Note that streamers are added to the
account that they have logged into through this application (not their
actual twitch account). For each streamer added to a users account a small
card will be made displaying the streamers info. Streamers can also be 
removed from the users account.
